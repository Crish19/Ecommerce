beetroot (project).
I decided to use python with dyango for my final project. 
I built a webpage capable of saving data in the back-end and showing this data to the front-end when required. 
Beside python and dyango I also used an small amount of javascript, HTML and CSS. 
Also other tools like strip and ajax were used.
